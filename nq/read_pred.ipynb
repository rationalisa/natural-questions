      "<P> In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge .

Therefore , short waves directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth at great distances , beyond the horizon . This is called skywave or `` skip '' propagation . Thus shortwave radio can be used for very long distance communication , in contrast to radio waves of higher frequency which travel in straight lines ( line - of - sight propagation ) and are limited by the visual horizon , about 40 miles ( 64 km ) . Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas ; sometimes entire continents or beyond .
